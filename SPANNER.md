## Spanner MCP Server (Data Plane: Connecting and Querying)

This section covers connecting to a Spanner instance.

1.  **Verify Environment Variables**: The extension requires the following environment variables to be set before the Gemini CLI is started:

    *   `SPANNER_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
    *   `SPANNER_INSTANCE`: The Spanner instance ID.
    *   `SPANNER_DATABASE`: The Spanner database ID.
    * `SPANNER_DIALECT`: The Spanner database dialect e.g. "googlesql" or "postgresql"

2.  **Handle Missing Variables**: If a command fails with an error message containing a placeholder like `${SPANNER_PROJECT}`, it signifies a missing environment variable. Inform the user which variable is missing and instruct them to set it.

3.  **Handle Permission Errors**: If you encounter permission errors, ensure the user has the correct Spanner permissions (e.g., `spanner.databases.get`, `spanner.databases.select`). The user likely lacks the role **Cloud Spanner Database User**
(`roles/spanner.databaseUser`) or **Cloud Spanner Database Reader** (`roles/spanner.databaseReader`). You can provide these links for assistance:
